              Hi everyone, we're Brian Chang and Sara Dadafshar, members of the
              Social and Player Dynamics team on VALORANT. In this article, we
              go in-depth on our past and ongoing work to detect and mitigate
              AFK (Away From Keyboard) behavior.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Introduction: Tackling the AFK Problem</h3>
            <p>
              Someone who is “AFK” is a player who leaves or doesn't participate
              during a match, a common issue in multiplayer games—especially in
              competitive, team-based ones like VALORANT. AFKs compromise match
              fairness and reduce overall enjoyment, making it a key problem the
              Social and Player Dynamics team set out to solve early on.
            </p>
            <p>In addressing AFKs, we focused on three main goals:</p>
            <li>
              <strong>Fairness :</strong> Avoid punishing players for rare,
              uncontrollable incidents (e.g., sudden disconnection).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accuracy :</strong>
              Build a scalable system that detects AFKs without false positives
              (e.g., holding an angle).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Effectiveness :</strong>
              Use clear, measurable benchmarks to track progress and ensure
              fewer AFK encounters over time.
            </li>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>What Have We Done So Far?</h3>
            <p>
              In March, we introduced our first AFK detection system, starting
              with a basic model that flagged players who disconnected or stayed
              completely inactive for extended periods. While this caught most
              AFKs (whether due to connection issues, rage-quitting, or even
              cats), it didn't account for players who intentionally remain idle
              while appearing active to avoid disconnection. To address this, we
              implemented scalable trackers that detect specific in-game
              behaviors tied to intentional AFKing, though we avoid disclosing
              details to prevent misuse.
            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure fair punishment, we developed an AFK “rating” system
              that tracks each player's history. Occasional AFKs result in minor
              consequences like a warning, while frequent offenders face
              escalating penalties—from XP denial to queue restrictions, and
              eventually bans. We also accounted for exceptions, such as
              Deathmatch AFKs, which only result in XP loss since they don't
              impact teammates. However, we remain vigilant against players
              exploiting Deathmatch for XP farming through AFK behavior.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>The Result?</h3>
            <p>
              There's a couple of data points that we look to measure this. We
              could spend a whole article talking about just the data (in terms
              of how we measure, potential biases, etc.), but here are some of
              our benchmarks:
            </p>
            <h4>1. AFKs Detected Over Time</h4>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../Source/news/Dev-2/Dev2-1.jpg" />
            </figure>
            <p>
              We've tracked the rate of severe AFKs—defined as being AFK for 6
              or more rounds—in Unrated and Competitive matches over time. While
              the rate remained steady during the first months after launch, it
              dropped significantly in early 2021, coinciding with the rollout
              of improved detection and penalties. Overall, the AFK rate has
              more than halved over the past year and has since stabilized at a
              much lower level.
            </p>
            <h4>2. AFK Reports</h4>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../Source/news/Dev-2/Dev2-2.jpg" />
            </figure>
            <p>
              The top graph displays the AFK report rate (reports per hours
              played), while the bottom graph shows the percent change in that
              rate since the start of the year. After a noticeable drop in
              March, AFK reports have decreased by around 17% since January.
              While it's possible players stopped reporting, comparisons with
              other report categories suggest this decline reflects real
              improvement from our efforts.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Better Detection, Better Informed</h3>
            <p>
              Our efforts to detect and penalize AFKs have made a significant
              impact, reducing their occurrence in games. However, there's still
              work to be done. We'll continue to improve detection by expanding
              the behaviors we monitor, as players find new ways to AFK. Many of
              these methods overlap with other disruptive actions, like griefing
              and bot farming. We're also committed to keeping you informed
              about our progress and any upcoming changes. Your feedback is
              crucial in helping us create a safer, more enjoyable experience in
              VALORANT. Stay tuned for future updates, including a focus on
              toxic gameplay behaviors. Thanks for reading!
