            <p>
              Hey everyone! Today, we wanted to share some insights from the dev
              team about the new weapon—the Outlaw. We'll be adding this new
              sniper to everyone's arsenal at the start of Episode 8 Act 1. It's
              been a while since we've talked about weapons in Palorant in
              general, and it's also the first time we're adding a new one since
              launch. So we want to discuss how the decision was reached to
              expand the arsenal.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Weapon Philsophy</h3>
            <p>
              One of our core goals for weapons in Palorant has always remained
              the same:<strong>
                every weapon should have a reason to be purchased.
              </strong>
              We fleshed this<strong> philosophy </strong> out early on in
              Palorant's development and it was our North Star when creating the
              Outlaw.
            </p>
            <p>
              Launching a new weapon is different from adding a new Agent or
              map—anyone can buy it, so it impacts gameplay more directly.
              That's why every weapon needs a clear purpose, with strengths and
              weaknesses that affect your round-by-round decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it's grabbing an Odin on Ascent defense as Sova or
              clutching a round with a Sheriff, each weapon should offer value
              and counterplay. In 2023, we saw a gap in our sniper lineup. After
              testing and exploration, the Outlaw emerged as the right fit to
              fill that role.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Designing a 2-Shot Sniper Rifle</h3>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../Source/news/GameUpdates-1/GameUpdates1-2.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>
              The Outlaw is a mid-priced sniper designed to give players more
              sniping options and add strategic depth to Palorant. It bridges
              the gap between the Marshal and Operator, blending traits from
              both while introducing its own twist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its defining feature: two quick shots without unscoping—perfect
              for high-impact plays. But with a long reload, there's risk if you
              miss or overextend, staying true to our weapon design philosophy
              of strengths, weaknesses, and purpose.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../Source/news/GameUpdates-1/GameUpdates1-3.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>
              Once we landed on the Outlaw as a 2-shot sniper, we still had to
              prove it in action—while keeping room for future balance tweaks,
              like we did with the Judge. A key focus was making sure it felt
              distinct and recognizable in-game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sound design played a big role. We created unique audio cues for
              full and partial reloads so players can identify when an enemy is
              reloading. Each reload also has different timings and animations
              based on how many shots you've fired, ensuring clarity and impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Visually, a break-action reload (like a shotgun) best fit the
              Outlaw's mechanics, setting it apart from the Marshall and
              Operator. And to add even more identity, it fires slugs instead of
              traditional bullets—giving it a powerful, punchy feel.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Hitting The Range</h3>
            <p>
              The Outlaw expands sniper options with a one-shot body kill
              against Light Armor, making it a real threat in various econ
              rounds. As our first post-launch weapon, we'll be watching its
              impact closely, staying true to our balance philosophy. Your
              feedback—and your best plays—will help shape its future and keep
              Palorant evolving.
